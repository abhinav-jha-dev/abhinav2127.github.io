I joined Nagarro in "2019" after 4 years of a stint with multiple startups where I learned all about the business from development to marketing and became `"Jack of all trades"`. Over time, I have moved into three different roles: `Software Engineer`, `Software Developer`, and `Senior Software Developer`. My journey has been challenging and demanding. Nagarro believes in its people and this holds in every sense. The flexibility of working hours, in Nagarro, is beyond perfect or I would rather say ‘par excellence’. I strongly believe that `time management` and `self-discipline` are two very important aspects to be successful. I've been involved in managing cultural activities, organizing competitions within the organization, and leading my team to victory. Work-life for me means juggling between the workplace, home, family, and friends. I usually start my work early in the morning so that I can wrap up most of the day’s tasks by afternoon. I keep an hour or so in the evenings to check for any urgent deliverables.

I'm a strong believer in communication. “It is difficult for others to sense your exact situation, and instead of just reporting your problems, it is better to share daily activities and challenges. And, always be thankful for others at the workplace.”
