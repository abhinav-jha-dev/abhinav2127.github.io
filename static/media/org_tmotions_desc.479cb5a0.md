###### My Roles
<!-- ResumeKey -->
I joined TMotions in "2016" after 2+ years of a stint experience with multiple startups where I focussed on building base for my Full Stack Developer experience and became "Bridge for my Goals". Over time, I have worked in Front-End Development and Software Engineer. My journey has been challenging and demanding, I feel being more active into it. Working with TMotions help me to building leader skill by giving me opportunity to lead small team for building plugins.

I strongly believed that time management and self-discipline are two very important aspects to be successful in Software Development. I started working on building media solutions for existing project of Haymarket Media group of UK, by building Angular based web components and Web APIs for Data Manipulation.

I've worked on building Data Import Solution for Haymarket which I've explained [here](http://localhost:3000/organizations/Haymarket%20Media%20UK). I believe in strong leadership skill where leaders help there resources to grow and improve their skills and by luck I found great leaders to work within the organization, which help me to polish my skills and improve my productivity.
