###### My Roles
<!-- ResumeKey -->
As I said it's a most challenging environment for my to work with, and I've tried to give my best for learning ColdFusion and FarCry(ColdFusion Framework for web development). I've worked for 3 months in this project and learned quite a lot by digging into code and refactoring bad code.

ColdFusion is more than 20 years old and there are not a huge community to support the development and with FarCry it brings another level of complexity as there is no explainatory documentation for this framework. Working as a support developer for maintaining old applications, I found that I'm not comfortable with these technologies. To overcome this I've to dig deep into how things works with ColdFusion.

So, what actually I've learned from working with this project, I've learned about language processing, Virtual Machines, and caching and performance optimization with ColdFusion. I've introduced caching within the application and gave a boost of 40% in execution time. I've refactored bad code which causes memory leeks and improved boot load size. Sql query optimization was also a part of work that I've to perform with this project to improve list load time from 8 secs to 1 sec. Interestingly I found myself in a position to guide my team more on FarCry fundamentals and helped them to build features in latest architecture. Working for short time in this project, helped to build self reliability on my knowledge and build solutions for the client.
