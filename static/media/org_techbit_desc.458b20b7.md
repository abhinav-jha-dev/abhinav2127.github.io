###### My Roles
<!-- ResumeKey -->
I joined **Techbit** in "2016" after completing one year of stint work with **Ashtbit Technologies** as a Front-End Developer. After covering Front-end technologies for a long time, I wanted to move towards Full Stack Development and Techbit gave me that opportunity. I got a chance to work with .*Net Core (Latest framework)* framework to build web API'S and windows service for the background process.

As a `Full Stack Developer`, I worked with `.Net Core APIs` and leaned concepts of `Web API`, `Design Patterns`, and `dependency Injection`. I had also improved my Time Management Skills and even created sample applications for managing my tasks at work. The most challenging part was to build a Template Generation process that uses `Abstract Factory`, `Strategy`, `Singleton`, and `Factory Method Patterns` to build Dynamic Bus timetables for transportation services. I had also worked with `parallel programming` for generating multiple templates to reduce time and improve performance.

I also developed a `Single SingOn Applications` for multiple portals that were built using Identity Server. It took a lot of effort at first but after continuous learning and exploration, I was able to successfully build a solution for it.
