###### My Roles
<!-- ResumeKey -->
I have worked as a Front-End Developer and Software Engineer for a while now and my journey has been challenging and demanding. It was time to build my leadership skills now and TMotions helped me to do that by giving me endless opportunities to lead multiple teams for building solutions for the clients.

I strongly believed that time management and self-discipline are two very important aspects to be successful in Software Development. I started working on building media solutions for the existing project of Haymarket Media Group, by building Angular based web components and Web APIs for Data Manipulation.

I've worked on building Data Import Solution for Haymarket which I've explained [here](./Haymarket%20Media%20UK). I believe in strong leadership skills where leaders help their resources to grow and improve their skills and by luck, I found great leaders to work within the organization, which help me to polish my skills and improve my productivity.
