###### My Roles
<!-- ResumeKey -->
I've join CBRE Gurgaon office for few months before Covide19 hits the economy and was released form the service. I worked with Core Development team for the Development of products and services for their customers. Working with large teams help me to become a better team player, where I present myself as quick learner and fast implementer of new functionalities.

With strong hold on Javascript and coming from Angular background, I've to totally switched myself to React and Redux frameworks. A steep learning curve for me, but digging for 1 week I've covered basic understanding of core concepts and started framing the application architecture for front-end application. Since they have consistency with application architecture, it was complex for me at first to frame the same as they have followed till now. Working with front-end app I've found an old bug related to state management in forms, which I've resolved while working simultaneously with the team and got appreciated for that.

Working with Back-end api development is a daunting task for me, as there are different level of challenges waiting for me. I've covered both Microservice and Azure Service Bus implementation with .Net Core 3.1 WebApi in 15 days, where I've no idea about how these things work together. It was a time where my patience and determination of learning new things helps me to improve my understanding. Now, I'm still moving towards Could Computing and exploring red zones for better understanding.
