###### My Roles
<!-- ResumeKey -->
I joined `Ashtbit` in "2015" as an Intern to start my carrier as `Front-End Developer`. Worked as a freelance developer during my Bachelor Studies for Designing and PHP Website Development, which gave me exposure of core understanding in `application architecture` and `application designing`. Before joining `Ashtbit` I've covered `Website and Mobile Application Designing`, `Logo Designing`, and `Product Designing`. 

During my Internship I've worked hard to learn Core concepts of `CSS` and `Javascript`, with `AngularJS` framework. With the help of my team, I felt comfortable in covering up most of the topics and under the guidance of a great mentor I completed my training in excellence and joined `Ashtbit` family as `Front-End Developer`.

As a `Front-End Developer` I've majorly worked on building widget for Digital Signage Display's and created web components for Databeat.Net Web Portal, which I've explain [here](https://abhinav2127.github.io/organizations/Databeat%20-%20Digital%20Signage). The most challenging thing for me was to manage `Pixel Density` between Displays and writing CSS and Javascript in a way to automatically support it. I've also created Digital Content for some indian customers and created `Video Projects` for Branding.

Working with `Ashtbit`, I've also learned about `SVG` and `Canvas` Designs, and created `Analog Clock widget` for Displays. `SVG` and `Canvas` open a new boundaries for me, and I've created some of the most complex work with them. I've utilized my free time in building `Canvas` games, like `Tic Tak Toe`, and `Unfaithful Snake`, which was a fun experience experience for me.
