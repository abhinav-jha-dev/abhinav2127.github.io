###### My Roles
<!-- ResumeKey -->
My journey with T-motions has been fruitful. I got an amazing opportunity to work on an e-commerce framework and lead a small team that had a lot to offer. Together we created a plugin for NopCommerce and implemented it within the framework. The plugin was for business to view and validate orders and purchases across the world. We developed it using SignalR and Goggle Maps for listing real-time orders on the page.

I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project and gained a lot of knowledge about Web Sockets and other real-time solutions for browsers and found that SignalR is the best approach because it automatically selects the framework for server-client communication. After my research, I created a POC for implementing it with Angular and .Net Core.

We did face numerous hurdles while developing this plugin related to syncing database calls, multiple observers, and implementing filters for pointing locations, etc. But with the help of my incredible team, we were able to deploy it successfully.
