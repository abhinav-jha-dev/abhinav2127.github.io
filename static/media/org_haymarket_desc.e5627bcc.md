###### My Roles
<!-- ResumeKey -->
Haymarket project brings new challenge from my first day working with them. We where providing our services as a small team then moving forward they want us to manage there Software Development life cycle.

I've created a Data Import mechanism for importing data from different sources and mapping them to our entity schemas. Which help them to import millions of records in batches as a background service for there clients. Here I've tried to show, how it works,

This is the big picture of application, but in background we process batches in multiple treads, which help us to import faster. Logger is used to log information about error and validations. We also export Json for failed imports. I will try to explain in more detail in my blog.
