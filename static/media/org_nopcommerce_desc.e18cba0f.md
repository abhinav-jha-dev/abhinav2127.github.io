###### My Roles
<!-- ResumeKey -->
Working with Tmotions Global Pvt. Ltd. I got an opportunity to work on this ecommerce framework. I've create a plugin for them in which I've lead a small team for implementing it within the framework. The plugin is for the Business people to view and validate order purchases across the world. The plugin is developed with `SignalR` and `Goggle Maps` for listing realtime orders on the page.

For developing this I've learned about Web Sockets and other real time solutions for browsers and found that SignalR is the best approach because based on the browser it automatically select the framework for server client communication. After my research I created a POC for implementing it with Angular and .Net Core.

While implementing it with `nopCommerce` we have faced many hurdles related to syncing database calls and working with multiple observer and implementing filters while pointing locations, but with help of my team we have achieved it.
