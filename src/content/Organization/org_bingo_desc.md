###### My Roles
<!-- ResumeKey -->
Talking about my project with **Bingo Industries**, it has been very challenging. I did get the opportunity to learn ColdFusion and FarCry(ColdFusion Framework for web development). In just three months, I learned quite a lot by digging into their code and refactoring it.

ColdFusion is in the market for the past 20 years and there is not a huge community to support the development with FarCry, it brings another level of complexity as there is no explanatory documentation for this framework. Working as a support developer for maintaining old applications, I noticed that I'm not comfortable with these technologies. To overcome this problem, I had to dig deeper into how things work with ColdFusion.

###### What I had learned here and how this experience has helped me?

I learned about language processing, Virtual Machines, and caching and performance optimization with ColdFusion. I had introduced caching within the application and gave a boost of 40% in the code execution time. I refactored their code that caused memory leaks and improved boot load size. I did SQL query optimization that was also a part of the work that I had to perform to improve list load time from 8 secs to 1 sec. Interestingly, I found myself in a position to guide my team more on FarCry fundamentals and helped them to build features in the latest architecture. This project was short and crisp, but it helped me to build self-reliability on my knowledge and build solutions for the client.
