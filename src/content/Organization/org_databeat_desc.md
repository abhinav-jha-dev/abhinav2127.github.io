As the starting of my carrier in Software Development, I've been doing some freelance work related to designing and frontend development. I joined Ashtbit as Front-End Developer and got a chance to work on some amazing projects. I would like to talk about this specific project where I got the opportunity to build widgets for them, which were displayed on different devices. During this time, I used CSS, Javascript, SVG, and Canvas for showing components inside widgets. to give a small glace of the widget, I'm attaching an image,

###### Let's dig into it!!

DatabeatOMNI is the software portal for selecting widgets for devices. Where we have more than 20 widgets from a simple Clock to some Social media widgets for Instagram, Facebook, etc. These widgets were made to display on platforms like Android, Samsung, and Windows. Further, those widgets were used as signage.

I've also worked on designing content for different brands and also created some interactive content for touch screen signage.
