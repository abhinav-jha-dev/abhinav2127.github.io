###### My Roles
<!-- ResumeKey -->
I've joined the CBRE Gurgaon office just a few months before Covid-19 made a drastic impact on our economy and was released from the service. I worked with the Core Development Team for the Development of products and services for their customers. Working with large teams has helped me to become a better team player, where I presented myself as a quick learner and implemented a lot of new functionalities.

With a stronghold on Javascript and coming from Angular background, I had to switch myself to React and Redux frameworks. Although it was a steep learning curve for me, I was able to understand the core concepts in a week and started framing the application architecture for the front-end application. Since they have consistency with the application architecture, it was difficult for me at first to create the same architecture as they have followed till now. Working with the front-end application, I've found an old bug related to state management in forms, which I've resolved while working simultaneously with the team and got appreciated for that.
Working with Back-end API development was a daunting task for me, as there were different levels of challenges waiting for me. I've covered both Microservice and Azure Service Bus implementation with .Net Core 3.1 WebApi in 15 days, where I had no idea about how these things work together. It was a time where my patience and determination to learn new things helped me to improve my understanding. Now, I'm still moving towards Cloud Computing and exploring to understand my red zones.
